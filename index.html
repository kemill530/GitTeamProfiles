        <p>BORN INTO a science fiction family, Mike read about science fiction easter eggs from an early age,
            imagining their existence as being from ulterior realities. This became a serious game as he grew
            up and learned the actual mathematics behind such thoughts. Thus his studies of astrophysics 
            commenced. This of course is a fictionalized account written as a profile for Team Venice.</p>

    <p>I'm 24, born and raised here in Indianapolis.  I graduated from Indiana University in 2021 with a bachelor of science in kinesiology.  I had intentions of becoming a physical therapist with that degree but decided against it towards the end of undergrad.  After graduating I ran the kitchen at a winery in Westfield called Urban Vines up until this class started and now I'm here.</p>

        Kali is looking forward to the day she actually goes to Venice. But really would be happy with just about any vacation!
