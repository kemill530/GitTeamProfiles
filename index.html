        <h3>Mike's Profile</h3>
        <img src="./images/CP_U03E.jpg" alt="JMV Venetian Egg" width="200" height="200">
        <p>BORN INTO a science fiction family, Mike read about science fiction easter eggs from an early age,
            imagining their existence as being from ulterior realities. This became a serious game as he grew
            up and learned the actual mathematics behind such thoughts. Thus his studies of astrophysics 
            commenced. This of course is a fictionalized account written as a profile for Team Venice.</p>
