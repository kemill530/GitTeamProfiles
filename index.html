    <p>I'm 24, born and raised here in Indianapolis.  I graduated from Indiana University in 2021 with a bachelor of science in kinesiology.  I had intentions of becoming a physical therapist with that degree but decided against it towards the end of undergrad.  After graduating I ran the kitchen at a winery in Westfield called Urban Vines up until this class started and now I'm here.</p>
